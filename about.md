This is the blog of the [JRubyArt][jruby_art] developer. Learn how to create [processing sketches][processing] in ruby using regular ruby-2.6 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them. You can use both [rubygems][gem] and and regular [processing libraries][libraries] in your sketches. Features create, run, watch and live modes (uses pry). In this blog I will post articles that should be interesting for people coming to JRubyArt from both ruby and processing backgrounds (although some knowledge of both is assumed).
