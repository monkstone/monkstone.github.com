[JRubyArt][jruby_art] is a ruby wrapper for [processing-3.0.1][processing].  Create processing sketches in ruby using regular ruby-2.2 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them. You can use both rubygems and and regular processing libraries in your sketches. Features create, run, watch and live modes (uses pry). In this blog I will post articles that should be interesting for people coming to JRubyArt from both ruby and processing backgrounds (although some knowledge of both is assumed).
