In a [recent release of JRubyArt][refactor] I have refactored `runner.rb` to use optparse to parse command line arguments, see also [new web-site][jruby_art]. This should make it easier for others to participate in JRubyArt development. In particular there is an opening for someone to create an option to export sketches to an `app`. Also the more modular nature of the refactored JRubyArt, may help anyone thinking of creating a [Raspberry Pi][pi] port (possible with included processing jars like [propane][propane]), JRubyArt works just fine with open-jdk. Would complement the excellent [Sonic Pi][sonic]. PS: wouldn't it be great to mix the two!!! See follow up post:-

{% highlight bash %}

Usage: k9 [options] [<filename.rb>]
    -v, --version                    JRubyArt Version
    -i, --install                    Installs jruby-complete and examples
    -?, --check                      Prints configuration
    -a, --app                        Export as app NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
    -w, --watch                      Watch/run the sketch
    -r, --run                        Run the sketch
    -l, --live                       As above, with pry console bound to $app
    -c, --create                     Create new outline sketch
    -h, --help                       Display this screen

{% endhighlight %}


The `--nojruby` flag is dropped in favour of the configuration option in `~/.jruby_art/config.yml` see below:-


{% highlight bash %}

---
PROCESSING_ROOT: "/usr/share/processing"
JRUBY: true
sketchbook_path: "/home/tux/sketchbook"
template: bare
MAX_WATCH: 32


{% endhighlight %}

To use jruby-complete as a default set `JRUBY: false` in `config.yml`

To install jruby-complete

{% highlight bash %}
k9 --install
{% endhighlight %}

This command also installs the examples (so if you want to keep the original 
examples, move them first). Also if `~/.jruby_art/config.yml` is not on your system it is optimistically created (ie you should probably edit it).

To check config at any time:- 

{% highlight bash %}
k9 --check
{% endhighlight %}

Creating bare sketches is as simple as:-

{% highlight bash %}
k9 --create fred 200 200 p2d
{% endhighlight %}

The `bare` sketch template is used by default, for class wrapped or emacs sketches change the template in `~/.jruby_art/config.yml`.

PS: development version is available from rubygems (just make sure you move original examples and config.yml before you do install)

For a gui you could do worse than use [jEdit][jedit] with my [revised commando file][commando].
