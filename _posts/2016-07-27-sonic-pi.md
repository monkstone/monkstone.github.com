### The possibilities ###

Sam Aaron has created a wonderful live coding tool [Sonic-Pi][sonic] targeting the [Raspberry-Pi][pi], and educational usage, but it can be installed/used on other desktops, and enjoyed by anyone. Part of the attraction is the gorgeous interface, but the main selling point is the live-coding that gives instant feedback. Now it was hell of a lot of work to create that gorgeous interface.  I can't see anyone doing that for [JRubyArt][jruby_art], although Tyfkda-san seems to have revived his interest in creating a [ruby mode][mode] for the processing ide (a somewhat less gorgeous ide in my opinion), but part of the unique selling point of ruby-processing/[JRubyArt][jruby_art] is the _pseudo-live_ coding. Interestingly it might be possible to have real live coding (but only for code in the draw loop) that could provide a graphical complement to [Sonic-Pi][sonic]. See Sam Aaron explaining live-coding with [Sonic-Pi on youtube][youtube].

### Current work ###

I have somewhat refactored [JRubyArt][jruby_art] with the view to making it more amenable to change (taking some inspiration from [99-bottles][bottles] by Sandi Metz and Katrina Owen), but it is very much a work in progress. I am also experimenting with a different approach for [watch][propane] that could be the basis for live coding in the draw loop.

### The opportunities ###

I am sure Tyfkda-san would appreciate some help with the [ruby processing mode][mode], I am somewhat otherwise engaged. There is the possibility of hooking up [JRubyArt][jruby_art] to the [atom editor][atom] as has been done for [vanilla processing][vanilla], which would surely make [JRubyArt][jruby_art] a more attractive option. I have already updated my [jEdit for processing package][jedit], but there is an opportunity of updating the [textmate/sublime][textmate] ruby-processing bundles for use with [JRubyArt][jruby_art]. Vim and emacs users should already know what to do?

Other opportunities are the creation/re-introduction of application export, or the creation of a version to run on the [raspberry-pi][pi] possibly as a [standalone app][propane] that would not require installing of Oracle java.
