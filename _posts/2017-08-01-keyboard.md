### Use Find in Project to search for examples containing code snippets

Recently I had the need to search for examples using `key_pressed?` as an example. With the atom editor it was a simple as

1. `File` `Add Project Folder` and loading the `propane_examples`.
2. `Find` `Find in Project` and entering `key_pressed?` followed by `Find All`
