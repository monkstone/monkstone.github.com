I have created a snapshot of [JRubyArt-1.7.0][Legacy] as a wrapper to support anyone wishing to stick with the original JRubyArt. This I have named [JRubyArtLegacy][Legacy] and unless anyone wants to take it forward I am proposing a final release to match JRuby-9.2.8.0 release (and stuck with using jdk-1.8.0). Thereafter developing [JRubyArt-2.0][JRubyArt] as a stand-alone ruby implementation of processing (not tied to vanilla processing) and supporting the use jdk11+.
