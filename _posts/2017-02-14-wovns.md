### WOVNS

[WOVNS][wovns] is a San Francisco based company that is a textile studio and technology platform, giving designers access to the means of textile production.  Working with US textile manufacturers, they have developed a patent pending system for jacquard looms that enables textile production in quantities as small as a single yard. Customers simply access their selection of colors and qualities, apply them to their own designs. On their site is a tutorial by [David A. Mellis][mellis] that shows how to create processing sketches that you can use to create WOVNS compatible designs see [examples on github][github].

### Ruby versions

The latest [JRubyArt][jruby_art] and [propane][propane] versions feature example sketches that create WOVNS compatible output. See [JRubyArt-examples][jruby_art_examples] and [propane-examples][examples]
