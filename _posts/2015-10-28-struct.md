If you are coming to JRubyArt from vanilla processing, you may not be aware of ruby `Struct`, which is an extremly useful way to add structure to data, and can often be used as lighweight alternative to a class eg as replacement for a 2D or 3D Vector class see below:-

{% highlight ruby %}
Vect = Struct.new(:x, :y)
origin = Vect(0, 0)
{% endhighlight %}

In two lines we have created a new `Struct`, `Vect` and created an instance `origin` of `Vect`. This is the usual way of doing but you may also come across the more verbose form:-

{% highlight ruby %}
class Vect < Struct.new(:x, :y)
end

origin = Vect.new(0, 0)
{% endhighlight %}

see simple [vector example][struct] and a more [complicated Turtle example][penrose]

But ruby is so versatile we can even add a `method` to our `Struct` to create for example a lightweight Boundary class (which can be very useful in JRubyArt sketches):-

{% highlight ruby %}
Boundary = Struct.new(:lower, :upper) do
  def include?(x)
    (lower...upper).cover? x
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}

see [fern.rb][fern] for example usage of our lightweight boundary class.

You may also be interested in the even more versatile `OStruct`, that takes hash args, but in practice I usually find myself creating a regular ruby class instead.
