### Simple Java 2D sketch ###

Further exploration of using `--add-opens` in java_args.txt in JRubyArt (should also work with propane). What I have found is that the module `org.jruby.dist` is not recognized in my setup (jdk12 and JRuby-9.2.8.0) so instead I tried `ALL-UNNAMED` which is what currently applies to the processing and JRubyArt packages anyway.

Quite possibly the reason `org.jruby.dist` is not recognized is that headius had yet to grips with naming the [automatic module](automatic) in the `jruby.jar` manifest

Running the simple fractions sketch gives the following warning without any `java_args.txt`:-

```bash
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.headius.backport9.modules.Modules to method java.lang.Object.finalize()

```

So I added `--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED` to java_args.txt

Running fraction this time gives:-

```bash
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.headius.backport9.modules.Modules to field java.io.FileDescriptor.fd

```

So I added `--add-opens java.base/java.io=ALL-UNNAMED` then ran sketch again which gave the following warning:-

```bash
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by com.headius.backport9.modules.Modules to method java.awt.Component.paramString()
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of com.headius.backport9.modules.Modules

```

Finally I added `--add-opens java.desktop/java.awt=ALL-UNNAMED` and the sketch ran with no illegal reflective-access warnings. When the JRuby modules are recognized you could be more specific about the modules that require the reflective access. Alternatively once modules are adopted then module-info could specifically open such access.

### A P3D sketch ###

Using the above `java_args.txt` I ran my `elegant_ball.rb` sketch to get the following warning specific to jogl reflective access:-

```bash
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by jogamp.opengl.awt.Java2D$2 to field sun.java2d.opengl.OGLUtilities.UNDEFINED
WARNING: Please consider reporting this to the maintainers of jogamp.opengl.awt.Java2D$2
```

So I added `--add-opens java.desktop/sun.java2d.opengl=ALL-UNNAMED` to java_args.txt and ran the sketch again to get this warning:-

```bash
WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
WARNING: Illegal reflective access by jogamp.nativewindow.jawt.JAWTUtil$1 to method sun.awt.SunToolkit.awtLock()
```

Finally I added `--add-opens java.desktop/sun.awt=ALL-UNNAMED` and the sketch ran with no reflective access warning. It should be possible for jogl and JRuby developers to fix these issues by not using reflective access (unlikely) or by creating modules that specifically open the packages to the modules.
