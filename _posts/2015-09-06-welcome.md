This blog is where I will publish articles that should be interesting to anyone wanting to dabble with JRubyArt, this is the successor to my learning ruby-processing blog (google blogger).  Check out the [JRubyArt GitHub repo][repo] and [JRubyArt wiki][wiki] for more info on how to get the most out of JRubyArt. File all bugs/feature requests at [JRubyArt issues][issues].
