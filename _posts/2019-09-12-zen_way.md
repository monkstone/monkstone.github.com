Vim fans can quickly create/modify and run sketches in JRubyArt first:-

```bash
mkdir my_sketch
cd my_sketch
k9 -c my_sketch 300 300 # creates an outline sketch
vim my_sketch.rb
```
![vim.png]({{site.github.url}}/assets/vim.png)

After editing save:-
```bash
:w
```

Here is the resulting sketch run from vim using:-
```bash
:!k9 -r %
```
NB: make sure `eol` line exists at end of script

![my_sketch.png]({{site.github.url}}/assets/my_sketch.png)
