JRubyArt supports the concept of a `static` sketch, where valid sketches could be a single lines of code. This is very similar to vanilla processing, however since JRubyArt-1.2.7 you can change the default sketch title and size via [configuration][configuration] `~/.jruby_art/config.yml`. You should delete any previous configuration to let our installer take a guess at your processing root:-

### configuration

```yaml
--- # config.yml
PROCESSING_ROOT: "/usr/share/processing" # Archlinux, adjust to your setup
JRUBY: true # set to false to use jruby-complete
sketchbook_path: "/home/tux/sketchbook3"
template: bare # class or emacs
MAX_WATCH: 40
sketch_title: 'JRubyArt Static Sketch'
width: 600
height: 600
```

### creating and `watching` a new sketch ###

For simplicities sake open a console and enter the following:-

```bash
mkdir my_sketch # so that we don't try to `watch` too many files
cd my_sketch
touch my_sketch.rb # create a blank file to work with
echo 'background 0' > my_sketch.rb
k9 -w my_sketch.rb
```

### pseudo live edit the running sketch ###

Now from a new console (opening from console needed to pick up the local `env`) we suggest using [vim][vim] or [atom][atom], but other editors are available.

```bash
cd my_sketch
vim my_sketch.rb # excellent lightweight editor OR
atom my_sketch.rb # modern configurable editor, with support for JRubyArt
```
Edit the sketch as required and on save `:w` [vim][vim] (do not quit) or save `Ctrl+S` [atom][atom] the sketch will then reload. Repeat as required, the sketch won't run with errors, but sketch should reload when `corrected`.

### classic hello world ###

```ruby
background 0 # black gray scale
message = 'Hello World'
fill 200, 0, 0 # red color RGB
my_font = create_font('Georgia', 48)
text_font(my_font) # set current font
text_align(CENTER, CENTER) # align text to center
text(message, (width / 2), (height / 2)) # place text in center

```
