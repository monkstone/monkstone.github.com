### Replacing ruby-processing global $app with a module variable

The original ruby-processing implementation created a $app variable, that gives global access to the sketch applet. It turns out that may not have been necessary, yet I have retained the global $app in propane and JRubyArt, however I'm pretty confident that I can replace the global `$app` with `Propane.app`. See below for propane:-

```ruby
module Propane
  class << self
    attr_accessor :app
  end
# ... and thereafter replace $app with Propane.app

end
```

Any sketch whose classes use `$app`, should be changed to use `Propane.app` or should `include Propane::Proxy`

I have made good progreess converting the propane-examples and as a bonus I intent to release alternative implementations of some sketches, illustraing the alternative of using `delegators` (forwardable) in place of `include Processing::Proxy` to access processing methods.

Look out for propane-2.5.0.
