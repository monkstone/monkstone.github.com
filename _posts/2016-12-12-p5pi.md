I don't know how I misses headius tweet about jruby on the [Raspberry-Pi][tweet], but it seems it should soon be possible to run jruby apps on the Raspberry-Pi. If that is is the case it might worth creating a custom version of [propane][propane] to run on the Raspberry-Pi (with OPENGL/JOGL binaries for arm). Or alternatively a stripped down version, without OPENGL. In headius tweet he was using the jirb console, it that is what floats your boat the advantage of propane over ruby-processing implementations it is easy to load and run propane sketches from irb/pry or if you have the patience from irb input.
