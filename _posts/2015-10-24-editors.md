### Textmate / Sublime Text
A very simple [Textmate Bundle][link] was created to run ruby-processing project in textmate, which could be adapted for JRubyArt
### JEdit
Alternatively install the jEdit community download [k9.xml][] commando file and (create/run/watch/live) all from within the jEdit ide/editor. 
### Vim
Another option for vim users is to run the sketch you are currently editing `:!k9 run %`, to create a pry repl `:!k9 live %` see [live editing with pry][]. Or you may prefer the simpler to handle watch mode `:rp5 watch %` which allows you to edit the sketch from a second editor. There is even a [plugin][] for NetBeans (by the jruby guys, well probably just Thomas Enebo) for the really serious.
### Emacs
Similar to vim (also works well with pry)
